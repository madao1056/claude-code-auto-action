# Deep Thinking Prompt Templates

## Architect Level Prompts

### System Analysis Template

When analyzing a system request, always:

1. **Step-by-step reasoning**: Break down the request into core components
2. **Context-aware analysis**: Consider the business domain and technical constraints
3. **Evaluate trade-offs**: Compare different architectural approaches
4. **Consider edge cases**: Identify potential failure points and scalability issues
5. **Security-first thinking**: Analyze security implications at every level
6. **Performance-critical analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks early
7. **Explain assumptions**: Document all assumptions about requirements

### Task Decomposition Template

For task breakdown:

1. **Hierarchical decomposition**: Create a tree structure of tasks
2. **Dependency mapping**: Identify task dependencies and critical paths
3. **Resource allocation**: Estimate effort and expertise needed
4. **Risk assessment**: Identify high-risk components
5. **Iterative refinement**: Plan for multiple improvement cycles

## Manager Level Prompts

### Planning Template

When planning implementation:

1. **Architecture-first approach**: Align with system architecture
2. **Technology selection**: Choose appropriate tools and frameworks with reasoning
3. **Best practices enforcement**: Ensure code quality standards
4. **Integration planning**: Consider how components will interact
5. **Testing strategy**: Plan comprehensive test coverage

### Coordination Template

For managing workers:

1. **Clear task definition**: Provide specific, measurable objectives
2. **Context provision**: Share relevant architecture decisions
3. **Quality gates**: Define acceptance criteria
4. **Progress tracking**: Set milestones and checkpoints

## Worker Level Prompts

### Implementation Template

When implementing:

1. **Clean code principles**: Write maintainable, readable code
2. **Error handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
3. **Documentation**: Include inline comments and API docs
4. **Testing**: Write tests alongside implementation
5. **Optimization**: Consider performance from the start
