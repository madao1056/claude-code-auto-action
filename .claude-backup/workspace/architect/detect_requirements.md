Analyze this requirement and determine what tools/dependencies need to be installed:
"Simple TODO API with CRUD operations"

Check if these tools are installed and install if missing:
1. Programming language runtimes (node, python, ruby, go, etc.)
2. Package managers (npm, pip, gem, cargo, etc.)
3. Database systems (postgres, mysql, mongodb, redis, etc.)
4. Build tools (make, cmake, gradle, etc.)
5. Container tools (docker, docker-compose)
6. Testing frameworks
7. Linting tools

For each missing tool:
- Check if it exists with 'which' or 'command -v'
- Install using appropriate package manager (brew, apt-get, etc.)
- Verify installation

Output a list of installed tools and any that couldn't be installed.
